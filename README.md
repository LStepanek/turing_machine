### **High-level summary**

This Turing machine operates as follows:

1. **Identify Two Integers**:
   - The machine scans the tape to locate two binary integers separated by a `#`.

2. **Perform Subtraction and Addition**:
   - The second binary integer is decremented by one in binary (subtraction).
   - The result is added to the first binary integer using binary addition with carry.

3. **Create Helper Symbol `c`**:
   - After performing the subtraction, the machine writes the helper symbol `c` to separate the first binary integer from the rest of the tape.
   - The `c` symbol acts as a temporary marker while the machine shifts the digits of the first binary integer toward the second integer.

4. **Shift the First Integer**:
   - The machine shifts the digits of the current first binary integer toward the second integer, from left to right.
   - The process continues until the two integers are separated by the helper symbol `c`.

5. **Replace Helper Symbol `c` with `#`**:
   - Once all digits of the first binary integer are shifted, the helper symbol `c` is replaced with `#`.
   - The process repeats, treating the two combined integers as the new "first" and "second" integers.

6. **Create Helper Symbol `b`**:
   - During the shifting process, the machine writes the helper symbol `b` to temporarily mark the boundary of the current first integer being shifted.
   - This symbol is replaced by `#` once the shifting is complete.

7. **Use of `h` for Last Two Integers**:
   - The helper symbol `h` is introduced only when the machine determines that only the last two binary integers remain on the tape.
   - These last two integers are summed up directly.

8. **Clean Up Intermediate Symbols**:
   - After completing the summation, the intermediate symbol `b` is replaced by `#`.
   - Any other helper symbols (`c` or `h`) are cleaned up.

9. **Halting Condition**:
   - The machine halts after the final summation of the last two integers and cleanup is complete.


### **Turing machine operation detailed description**

1. **State: `move_right_to_first_end`**
   - The machine scans right through `0`s and `1`s in the first binary integer.
   - Upon encountering `#`, transitions to `move_right_to_second_end`.

2. **State: `move_right_to_second_end`**
   - The machine continues scanning right through the `0`s and `1`s of the second binary integer.
   - Upon encountering another `#`, transitions to `check_if_then_halt`.

   - Moves left and transitions to `subtract_one_from_second`.

6. **State: `subtract_one_from_second`**
   - Decrements the second binary integer:
     - Writes `1` for `0`, moves left.
     - Writes `0` for `1`, transitions to `move_left_to_first_end`.
     - If `#` is encountered, transitions to `clean_up`.

8. **State: `add_one_to_first`**
   - Adds the carry from subtraction to the first binary integer:
     - Writes `1` for `0`, transitions to `move_right_to_first_end`.
     - Writes `0` for `1`, continues left.
     - Writes `1` for `#`, transitions to `move_right_to_first_end`.

9. **State: `clean_up`**
   - Removes intermediate symbols:
     - If `c` is read, transitions to `move_left_and_reach_digits`.
     - If `h` is read, transitions to `move_one_step_to_right_and_halt`.

10. **State: `move_left_and_reach_digits`**
    - Moves left through digits and `#`.
    - Upon encountering a `0` or `1`, transitions to `continue_to_leftmost_digit`.

11. **State: `continue_to_leftmost_digit`**
    - Moves left until it finds the leftmost digit of the current first integer.
    - Upon encountering `#`, transitions to `move_right_and_reach_c`.

12. **State: `move_right_and_reach_c`**
    - Moves right to locate the helper symbol `c`.
    - Upon finding `c`, transitions to `move_left_to_first_end_and_start_shifting`.

13. **State: `move_left_to_first_end_and_start_shifting`**
    - Begins shifting the first binary integer toward the second:
      - If `b` is read, transitions to `move_right_reach_c_and_replace_it_by_hash`.
      - If `0`, transitions to `move_right_and_shift_zero`.
      - If `1`, transitions to `move_right_and_shift_one`.

14. **State: `move_right_reach_c_and_replace_it_by_hash`**
    - Replaces `c` with `#` and transitions to `move_left_and_reach_leftmost_digit`.

15. **State: `move_left_and_reach_leftmost_digit`**
    - Moves left through digits and `#` to reach the leftmost digit of the next integer.
    - Upon encountering a `0` or `1`, transitions to `continue_to_leftmost_digit`.

16. **State: `move_right_and_shift_zero`**
    - Moves right, shifting a `0` to the second binary integer.
    - Transitions to `turn_left_and_shift_zero`.

17. **State: `move_right_and_shift_one`**
